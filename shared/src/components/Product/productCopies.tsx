        The vault generates yield by writing out-of-the-money call options on
        ETH on a weekly basis and selling the options to market makers in
        exchange for premiums. The vault repeats this process on a weekly basis
        and reinvests the premiums, effectively compounding the yields for

        The vault has a <b>manager</b> who selects the strike prices for the
        call options that the vault writes. This manager is responsible for
        making the best tradeoff between yield vs risk of the call options
