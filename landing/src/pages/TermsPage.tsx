            <p>
              5.1 Digital Assets: Digital asset prices are volatile and
              fluctuate day to day. Trading in these digital assets may be
              considered a high-risk activity. Proper diligence and sound
              judgement should be used in evaluating the risks associated with
              these activities. We do not solicit nor represent that digital
              assets are an investment vehicle. The decision to trade digital
              assets rests entirely on the users' independent judgement. Any
              digital asset may decrease in value or lose value due to various
              factors, including the discovery of wrongful conduct, market
              manipulation, change to the nature or properties of a digital
              asset, or governmental or regulatory activity. Demand for digital
              assets may be partially or wholly driven by speculation or market
              sentiment.
            </p>
            <p>
              5.2 Lack of Information available: You may not have full access to
              all the information relevant to the particular Digital Asset or
              its underlying platform or network. It may not be possible to
              obtain updated information regarding the progress or any changes
              to particular Digital Assets or their underlying platforms or
              network. Many Digital Asset issuers or operators may also have no
              operating history or track record that any be used to evaluate the
              ability to achieve their stated project goals.
            </p>
            <p>
              5.3 Network Events: Digital Assets may be subject to various
              Network Events, including Forks, Airdrops, attacks on the
              security, integrity or operation of the networks, or Network
              Participants making a binding decision in relation to the network
              underlying a Digital Asset. Such events may affect the features,
              functions, operation, use or other properties of any Digital
              Asset, Network or platform. The events may also severely impact
              the price or value of any Digital Assets or even result in the
              shutdown of the network or platform associated with the Digital
              Asset. Such Network Events may be beyond the control of the User
              or Ribbon, or to the extent Ribbon has any ability to impact the
              Network Event, Ribbon's decision or actions may not be in your
              interests. Where you transfer digital assets to Ribbon which are
              the subject of a Network Event, you may not be entitled to the
              proceeds arising from any Network Event, and Ribbon is entitled to
              keep any digital assets created because of Network Events (for
              example, in circumstances where there is a fork in the network).
              The User should not transfer assets to Ribbon, where you wish to
              receive the benefits of those Network Events.
            </p>
            <p>
              5.4 Inflation Risk: Digital Assets may, either because of the
              inherent design of the digital asset or through Network Events,
              not be a fixed supply of assets. Where additional Digital Assets
              are created, the asset's price may decline due to the inflationary
              effects of adding additional Digital Assets to the total assets
              available.
            </p>
            <p>
              5.5 Concentration Risk: At any point in time, one or more persons
              may directly or indirectly control significant portions of the
              total supply of any particular Digital Asset. Acting individually
              or in concert, these holders may have significant influence over
              the Digital Asset and may be able to influence or cause Network
              Events which may have a detrimental effect on the price, value or
              functionality of the Digital Assets. Network Participants may make
              decisions which may not be in the User's best interest as a holder
              of Digital Assets.
            </p>
            <p>
              5.6 Suspensions of Trading/Network Events: Under certain
              conditions, liquidating a position in Digital Assets may be
              difficult or impossible. Certain Network Events (including total
              failure of a network) may occur rapidly and affect the ability of
              holders of Digital Assets to conduct transactions. Information
              relating to these Network Events may be difficult to ascertain
              ahead of time and may be subject to limited oversight by any third
              party capable of intervening to stabilise the network.

          <span>
            <p>
              6.1 Source code changes and flaws: The various source codes
              underlying Digital Assets and smart contracts are subject to
              change and may at any time contain one or more defects,
              weaknesses, inconsistencies, errors or bugs. Unless otherwise
              represented in writing by Ribbon, no audit or investigation has
              been conducted on any source code produced by parties other than
              Ribbon.
            </p>
            <p>
              6.2 Cryptographic advancements: Developments in cryptographic
              technologies and techniques, including the advancement of
              artificial intelligence or quantum computing, pose security risks
              to all cryptography-based systems, including Digital Assets.
              Applying these technologies and techniques to Digital Assets or
              the Ribbon Portal and Services may result in theft, loss,
              disappearance, destruction, devaluation or other compromises of
              digital assets, the Ribbon Portal and Services or your data.
            </p>
            <p>
              6.3 Reliance on the Internet: Digital Assets and the Ribbon Portal
              and Services rely heavily on the Internet. However, the public
              nature of the Internet means that either part of the Internet or
              the entire Internet may be unreliable or unavailable at any given
              time. Further, interruption, delay, corruption or loss of data,
              the loss of confidentiality in the transmission of data, or the
              transmission of malware may occur when transmitting data via the
              Internet. The result of the above may be that your order is not
              executed according to your instructions or not at all at the
              desired time.
            </p>
            <p>
              6.4 Unauthorised access: Unauthorised third parties may use the
              User wallet and effect transactions without your knowledge or
              authorisation, whether by obtaining control over another device or
              account used by the User or other methods.
            </p>
            <p>
              6.5 Loss of Private Key(s): Losing control of your private key(s)
              may permanently and irreversibly deny you access to digital
              assets. Neither Ribbon nor any other person will be able to
              retrieve or protect digital assets for which you hold the private
              key(s). If the private key(s) is lost, it may become impossible to
              transfer digital assets to any other address or wallet, and you
              are solely responsible for securing your private key(s) in a
              manner that meets the User security circumstances.
            </p>
            <p>
              6.6 Operational Risk: Breakdowns or malfunctioning of essential
              systems and controls, including IT systems or Digital Asset
              networks, may generally affect digital assets' value. In
              particular, digital assets may suffer from a concentration of
              operational risk during development, including key personnel,
              governance and financial control risk.

        answer: (
          <span>
            <p>
              7.1 Country Risk: If an investment is made in any Digital Assets
              issued by a party subject to foreign laws or transactions made on
              markets in other jurisdictions, including markets formally linked
              to a domestic market, recovery of the sums invested and any
              profits or gains may be reduced, delayed or prevented by exchange
              controls, debt moratorium or other actions imposed by the
              government or other official bodies. Before you use any Product,
              you should be familiar with any rules or laws relevant to the
              Services. Your local regulatory authority will be unable to compel
              the enforcement of the rules of regulatory authorities or markets
              in other jurisdictions where your transactions have been effected.
              You should obtain independent advice about the different types of
              redress available in both your home jurisdiction and other
              relevant jurisdictions before you start to trade. If your country
              of residence imposes restrictions on Digital Assets, we may be
              required to discontinue your access to the Portal and Services. We
              may not be permitted to transfer Digital Assets held in the
              Products back to the User or permit the User to transfer Digital
              Assets out of the Ribbon Services to the User or others until the
              regulatory environment permits us to do so.
            </p>
            <p>
              7.2 Taxation and required reporting to taxation authorities: You
              are responsible for all taxes in respect of any gains obtained in
              a Product, including past or retrospective taxes imposed on the
              Services. Before using any Product, you should understand the tax
              implications of acquiring, entering into, holding and disposing of
              a Digital Asset and a Product. Tax implications of any Service
              depend on the nature of your business activities and the Product
              in question. The User should consult their independent tax advisor
              to understand the relevant tax considerations.
            </p>
            <p>
              7.3 Regulatory Uncertainty: The Services are potentially exposed
              to regulatory/legal risk. The legal and regulatory treatment of
              Digital Assets may change. Regulation of Digital Assets is
              unsettled and rapidly changing. Legal and regulatory treatment
              varies according to the jurisdiction. The effect of regulatory
              legal risk is that any Digital Asset may decrease in value or lose
              all of its value due to legal or regulatory change. This may
              affect the value or potential profit of a Product. Legal changes
              may make a previously acceptable investment illegal or subject to
              substantial restrictions that may affect the ability to liquidate
              a position. Changes to related issues such as taxation may occur
              and radically affect the value or profitability of a Digital
              Asset. Such risk is unpredictable and depends on geopolitical,
              economic, sovereign and other factors. Risks may be asymmetrical
              between established and emerging markets and affect some Digital
              Assets significantly more than others. Ribbon recommends that the
              User obtains independent legal, tax and financial advice and
              continues to monitor the legal and regulatory position in respect
              of its use of the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
              7.4 Legal status of digital assets, Services and Portal: The laws
              of various jurisdictions may apply to Digital Assets or Services
              offered through the Ribbon Portal. Applying these laws and
              regulations to Digital Assets is largely untested, and laws and
              regulations are subject to change without prior notice to either
              Ribbon or the User. In particular, any current governmental or
              regulatory tolerance of Digital Assets may change rapidly, and
              Digital Assets may at any time be deemed to be a security,
              investment, asset or money by governmental authorities or
              regulators, which will affect Ribbon's ability to offer the
              Services. As a result of regulation and legislation around Digital
              Assets, the Portal may not be available in certain jurisdictions
              or at all. Changes to access to the Portal or the Services may be
              made unilaterally on short or no notice to the User. Ribbon may
              receive formal or informal queries, notices, requests or warnings
              by governmental authorities and regulators. Governmental
              authorities and regulators may take action against Ribbon. As a
              result of such events, Ribbon may be required to discontinue the
              Portal or Services. The User may also be subject to governmental
              or regulatory action by holding Digital Assets or using the Ribbon
              Portal and Services. The User should take independent legal advice
              to evaluate the consequences of using the Services before
              accepting this Terms of Use or using the Services.

              8.1 Suitability: You should decide to use any Service provided by
              Ribbon only after due and careful consideration. You should
              determine whether a Product is appropriate in light of your
              experience in similar transactions, your objectives in engaging
              with Ribbon, financial resources and other relevant circumstances.
              If you are unsure that the Product is suitable, you should obtain
