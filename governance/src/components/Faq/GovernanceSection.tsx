                particular point in time. The greater your veRBN balance, the

                Governance proposals are autonomous proposals made by veRBN
                holders to change the Ribbon Finance protocol. If a proposal
                receives at least XXX veRBN votes in support of it, the changes
                to the protocol specified in the proposal are autonomously
                executed.

                Governor Bravo is a governance framework that allows governance
                proposals to get executed autonomously instead of through loose
                consensus via a Snapshot vote and multisig execution.
