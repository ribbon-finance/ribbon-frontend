          The primary risk for running this covered call strategy is that
          depositors could potentially give up upside in exchange for guaranteed
          yield. This only happens when the call options get exercised, which
          should happen less than 3% of the time. In such a situation,
          depositors can still expect to be up significantly in USD terms.
