          Folkvang is a native crypto trading firm. With their proprietary
          technology, they trade on all major crypto markets around the clock.
          Since they began trading, they have grown the team from two people in
          Asia in 2018 to a global team of nine core contributors.
        </p>
        <p>
          In March 2020, Folkvang became more official and took on investment
          from SBF to seriously scale up their capital base and trading
          operations. They have been a part of global on-screen crypto flows
          ever since, trading billions of dollars every day on all major coins
          and exchanges.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a quantitative trading firm, Folkvang employs a variety of trading
          strategies, ranging from low latency HFT arbitrage on the biggest
          markets to degen yield farming. They are best known for the former,
          where their market-neutral HFT strategies make money from
          market-making, arbitrage, funding, and basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a weekly basis, Folkvang have had zero drawdowns since their start
          in March 2019.
